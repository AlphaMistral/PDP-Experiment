Use ProduceRequests to randomly produce requests and writes them into ../data/txts/request.txt
To get requests from different PolicySets(asms.txt,lms.txt,vms.txt), you need to manually modify them in ProduceRequests.cpp
The number of requests produced is also capable of being modified in ProduceRequests.cpp, arg named as NUM_OF_REQ

ReadRequests.cpp is used to test the function: readRequests()
